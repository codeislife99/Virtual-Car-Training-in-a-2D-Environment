# Reinforcement Learning
## Virtual Car Training in a 2D Environment

### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** with the [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted
) library installed

### Description

A virtual car is trained to drive in a 2D environment among other cars following traffic signals at crossroads, not crashing with other cars and getting to destination using Q-Learning. The state space and other parameters are included in the agent.py file. Alpha ,Epsilon ,Qinit,Gamma are tuned and value discounting implemented to achieve a success rate of 98 % . PyGame is used for visualization purposes.


### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```python Agent.py```  

This will run the `Agent.py` file and execute your agent code.
